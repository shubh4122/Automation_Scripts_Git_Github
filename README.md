# Automation_Scripts_Git_Github

These are some simple automation scripts written in BASH to automate github/git operations

- <em>gitAutomationScript</em> is a Simple script that just combines git add . amd git commit -m "MESSAGE" commands
- <em>gitHubAutomation</em> is a script that is quite useful. It automates the process of creating repo on Github and then copying its link back in the terminal and adding it as a remote to the local repo.
  One can do all that with just one command using this Script.
  Only pre-requisite is, to add your Github Token and username in the script before using it.
